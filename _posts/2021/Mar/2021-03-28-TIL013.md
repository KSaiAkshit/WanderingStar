## Main Stories

### Breaching BBB
Scientists have found ways to make nanobots that can breach the Blood-Brain Barrier. They use EColi to construct the bot and Rotating Magentic fields to move it around such that it then accumulates in brain. [*ScienceRobotics*](https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/6/52/eaaz9519)

### Timing F1
Transponders on F1 cars allow them to be tracked to within a ten thousandth of a second by transmitting radio waves. Timing loops are set about 1 cm into the F1 track, built out of lengths of wire that run across the width of the track and back protected in silicone. They’re spaced out every 150-200 m along the track, every time a car passes over it registers with the car’s transponder, transmitting a unique ID to a decoder that logs the time of day.


## QuickBits
> The creators of silicon valley would randomly go to google to look for new stories and solutions to problems

> In a chain of clicking the first link on every wiki page. The end point will be philosophy (95% of the time) which then loops back.
