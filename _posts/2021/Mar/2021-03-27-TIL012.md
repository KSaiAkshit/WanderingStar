*Cover Protein Folding*

## Main Stories
### Adjuvants
In immunology, an adjuvant is a substance that increases and/or modulates the immune response to a vaccine. Several of HepB vaccines have been using Aluminium as a vaccine since 1930s. In general there are many known adjuvants in widespread use, including aluminium salts, oils and virosomes.

### Ramachandran Plot
In biochemistry, a Ramachandran plot (also known as a Rama plot, a Ramachandran diagram or a [φ,ψ] plot), originally developed in 1963 by G. N. Ramachandran is a way to visualize Protein Folding.

### Rotman Lens
Rotman lens allows radar systems to simultaneously see targets in multiple directions (multi-beam capability) without physically moving the antenna system. This lens is now integrated into many radars and EW systems around the world.

Scientists are considering using this in combination with the 5G grid to power devices such that the grid can deliver several µW of power per device. [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79500-x)
