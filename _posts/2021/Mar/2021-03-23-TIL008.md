12% of the world's fish catch comes from this area, which is about 50% of the world's fishing vessels. Further below there are reserves of Natural Gas & Oil

China has started making claims in the Spratly Islands and heavility militarising them. There was an International Tribunal (2016 Hague) which rules that the Spartly Islands are rocks and not islands and hence do not benefit as EEZs. It stated that china's claims were illegitimate. China does not accept this ruling.

US Interests are primarily shipping and interfering with things that are none of their business

### Nile

#### Geography
The White Nile is usually considered the source stream and is the longer of the two. The Blue Nile while not so actually provides a larger amount of water to the river. Both meet in Sudan.

South Sudan is currently under Civil War for leadership where about 0.5M people have been killed.

There are two dams, the Aswan High & Low dams which store water for the low tide periods. To create these dams several temples and ancient temples were completely dismantled and reassembled safe from water.

#### Dependence
Most of the countries use it for Agriculture.

Egypt rain is 60-80% Blue Nile Water. Most of the country (98% people) lives on 3% of the land area largly surrounding the river (2/3rd just in the Delta), since the river is the only source of fresh water in the entire country (90% land is desert)

Egypt plans to build (since the 70s) a second path for the river which they can route through 3 oases. As of today only less than tha first part of this is made.

Ethiopia is now building a new dam attached to a hydroelectric power station on the Ethiopia-Sudan border which would double Africa's electricity production and form the largest reservior of water. This will take 10-15 years to fill.

#### Politics
The 2019 Peace prize winner & current PM of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed is claiming that this power station will not damage Egypt's water supply.
