## Main Stories

### Crypto
Facebook has renamed Libra to Diem and intends to make it a stable crypto currency. Unlike traditional crypto, stable crypto is tied to physical money like say the US Dollar. Visa has also launched their own crypto.

### VLBI
Scientists are using Very Long Base Interferometry to calculate the motion of the techtonic plates and the rotation of earth. Quasars very far away act like point sources of light and can be used to track subtle changes in the distance between two observatories and therefore the plates below.

### Kuramoto
Synchronisations of clocks first observed by Christian Huygens in 2 pendulum clocks (also invented by him for ships) hung from the same pole. The model used to calculate the motion of these pendulums on mapped onto a circle is called Kuramoto model. It uses the own frequency and also distance from other vectors on the circle to calculate the the motion
