## Main Stories

### ISRO
ISRO has successfully demonstrated free-space Quantum Communication over a distance of 300 m. The demonstration has included live videoconferencing using quantum-key-encrypted signals. This is a major milestone achievement for unconditionally secured satellite data communication using quantum technologies.

### Phantom Vibes
Phantom vibrations studied in medical professionals in 2013 found no correlation to anxiety. One in 2014 found a correlation with burnout & job stress. So the the relation is not yet clear. They tend to occur as a part of Signal Detection System of body in expectation of notifs or misclassification of muscle twitches.

### Gravity
While in space human body produces less blood to compensate for the extra pressure caused by loss of gravity since our heard pumps enough to compensate for that under normal circumstances. Altough just a year spaces causes a lot of leg pain, internal joint pain, muscle atrophies etc.

Artifical gravity from rotation is not the same as straight g. If you turn your head you will become dizzy due to ear fluid & CerebroSpinal Fluid sloshing around. When throwing a ball up also in a rotational grav field, the ball expeiences coriolis force.

Instead of joining a whole kms long struct a possible solution is this
