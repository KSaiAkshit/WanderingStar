*Cover Cherry Blossom Trees*


## Main Stories

### Holi
Most of India's color is made in Hathras, UP. This brings in a business of about $4M to the city. A 100 people work in both hand made and machine made systems. The production capacity is heavily dependent on agriculture season (inversely) and rain (inversely) since the color needs to be dried in open air.

### Shannon
Was the first to convert sounds to 1s & 0s and send that as pulses which can then be converted back to voice thus eleminating the noise of long distance analog audio and also creating the concept of bits.

### Senbonzakura

Japan's cherryblossom peaks have been more or less consistent since 800s to 1800s for 1000 years. Since the industrial revolution due to all the carbon we have been dumping the planet is heating up more and more as a result of whichs summer is coming earlier & they bloom earler.

### from the tyres to below the tyres
Scientists have optimized a process to convert waste from rubber tires into graphene that can, in turn, be used to strengthen concrete. Concrete is the most-produced material in the world, and simply making it produces as much as 9% of the worldâ€™s carbon dioxide emissions. This process reduces the concrete usage and also makes it longer lasting

0.1 wt% of graphene can reinforce the road by as much as 30% more.
