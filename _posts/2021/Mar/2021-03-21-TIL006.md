*Cover  Iceland Exclusive Economic Zone (as of '15)*

## Prime Stories
### Iceland & Climate
Over the years Iceland has used its strategic postion between China & USA in the sea to pressure NATO into allowing it to extend its Exclusive Economic Zone much further out. 

Since Iceland's economy is heavily dependent on fishing (25-30%) the local fish habitat has been reduced a lot as a consequence of which the government has introduced Individual Transferable Quotas which impose restrictions on fishing by species.

Due to global warming iceland is losing its glaciers (they even held a funeral for their first completely melted glacier). They are building a new port to take advantage of a new northern sea route which will open up due to melting of ice.
