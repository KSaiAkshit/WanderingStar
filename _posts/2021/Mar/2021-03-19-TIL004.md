### Territorial Waters
A region of 12 nautical miles outside coast of any country is territorial sea. For 200 nautical miles outside land the nation has exclusive economic zone or sole rights to resourse exploitation. In case of conflict each country resolves on case by case basis. Such as India-Sri Lanka where USUALLY midway line is drawn. Most un countries have signed this except Syria, Israel & Turkey. Their waters are therefore still under dispute mainly in the Aegean Sea.

As a consequence of these disputes also Cyprus is now divided into Republic of Cyprus (Internationally recognised) and Turkish Republic of Cyprus (Only Turkey recognised). Search for gas is making this worse. This currently creates two different sea ownership maps. One agreed upon by Greece-Egypt and one by Turkey-Libya.

Of all of the worlds gas reserves the highest are held by Russia followed by Iran then Qatar & USA. Iraq economy is dependent on 98% exports of Oil & Azerbaijan is also along similar lines 91% mineral products. Turkey on the other hand imports 30% of its national electricity source which is Natural Gas from Russia (50%) and rest Iran, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Nigeria and Qatar.

A linear city has been tried beofre also in Brazil. The city brazillia was supposed to be linear but it did not work out to be so due to high prices along the line. As a result of which new satellite cities started forming up in the end breaking the linear model.

## Market Makers
Payment for order flow is illegal in UK and everything goes to exchange. Market makers in both cases payment for order flows (0 commission) and otherwise collect the bid ask spread. SEC USA allows their existance as long as they declare who they route to. But Gamestop volatility is creating a problem here & is therefore under review.
