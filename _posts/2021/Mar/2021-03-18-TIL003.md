## Main Stories

### Botanical Forensics with Xyloscope
Machine uses ML to classify wood based on species with detailed high res images.

### Tsunamis in Planets
- It is theoreised that Mars had an ocean but does not show a shoreline because a mega-tsunami wiped out this shoreline
- Venus has clouds which move much much faster than the planet. This is probably because of surface waves which push air up
- Titan on saturn generates 

## Math

### Calculating Pi
Till before Newton we used sandwitch of inscribed and circumscribed larger and larger polynomials. Newton used binomial theorem with negetive and fractional numbers and extended the Pascals triangle.

Newton used binomial theorem to create
&#x222B;<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> (1-x<sup>2</sup>) = &#x222B; (Infinite series)
This was then converged better with
&#x222B;<sub>0</sub><sup>1/2</sup> (1-x<sup>2</sup>) = &#x222B; (rapid convergence Infinite series) with x at 1/2 = &pi;/12 + &#8730;3/8. Rearrange and solve.
