## Main Stories

### Lab Testing
Mice are the ideal candidates for lab testing because it is possible to order up mice identical to each other or some other mouse elsewhere because of its sequences. We can control exact mutations also

### Laser Audio
Lasers can be pointed to a window at a distance. The reflection of this laser can then be used to see what the pattern is. Audio & any other sound causes micro vibrations in glass which can be then converted to waveform.

### Roche Limit
Is a formula which calculates how close an object (say moon) can come to its parent (say planet) before the tidal forces of the planet rip it apart and create something like a saturn.
$$L_p = 2.44 (\frac{\rho_p}{\rho_s})^{1/3} R_p$$

### Chatalhöyük
We know from exacavations of Chatalhöyük from Anatolia (Turkey) from about 7000 BC show that society was egalitarian and no concept of a heirarchy existed. This were also the first people to probably use maps.


## QuickBits
> Institutional legacy is for those who live in the luminosity of the ones before them who have achieved something. It is for those with nothing of their own ~ NDT

> Voyager2 was actually sent 16 days before V1. V1 just took a shorter path and hence passed V2.
