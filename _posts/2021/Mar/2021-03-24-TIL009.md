Scientists are using Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. Where they cycle through excess oxygen and then bring back to normal values in cycles, in a high pressure chamber. The body sees this as hypoxia and regenerates stem cells. The telomeres' lengths increased by upto 20%. (*Aviv Scientific*)

### Making chips
There are very large machines which make microchips (by ASML), these use light usually of the order of 200nm coupled with a drop of water to use refraction to reduce the wavelength. Scientists are now preparing to make a leap top one order of magnitude down 10s of nanomenters of light beams.
