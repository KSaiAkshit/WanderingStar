## Prime Stories

### Syrian War (AS OF 2016)
Damascus is the oldest continuously inhabited city on the planet.
- **Red**: Syrian Govt i.e Bashar Al Assad. Russia Backed.
- **Green**: Opposition: USA Backed & Supplied(military equipment & CIA Training).
- **IS**: Islamic State (Terrorist Org, stemed from Al Qaueda), rule from Al-Raqqa
- **Yellow**: Kurdish Rojava, largely autonomous, progressive laws of equality & secularism.

Syria Turkey relations have also been poor due to conflicts on dams on Euphrates river.

- \>7M Displaced
- ~5M Refugees
- 0.5M Dead

This war is a human rights catastrophe


## Main Stories

### Aging
As we grow older Telomeres start shorening, as a result when these protections disappear, cells and as a consequence we, start to die.

Scientists are using Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. Where they cycle through excess oxygen and then bring back to normal values in cycles, in a high pressure chamber. The body sees this as hypoxia and regenerates stem cells. The telomeres' lengths increased by upto 20%. (*Aviv Scientific*)

### Making chips
There are very large machines which make microchips (by ASML), these use light usually of the order of 200nm coupled with a drop of water to use refraction to reduce the wavelength. Scientists are now preparing to make a leap top one order of magnitude down 10s of nanomenters of light beams. EUV Machines.

### ML Hardware
The core of ML is a MAC (Multiply Accumulate func). A &larr; A + (B x C). Even something as small as mobilenet needs 550M+ MAC operations to make a single inference. The cycle of fetching the data to ALU takes much longer & power to calculate the data itself (O(1):O($$10^2$$)). So we need Multiple ALUs which can store more data. Enter GPUs.

Problem is GPUs use 32/64 bit floating point. Which is overprocessing for ML use cases. We need at max 8B integer. This is ideal for CNNs. Google TPU is one such ex. Analog machine learning currently faces two problems, latency and accuracy. Data conversion takes time & heat and noise may change the result.
