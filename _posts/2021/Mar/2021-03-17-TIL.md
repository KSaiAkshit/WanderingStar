## Math

### Calculating Pi
Till before Newton we used sandwitch of inscribed and circumscribed larger and larger polynomials. Newton used binomial theorem with negetive and fractional numbers and extended the Pascals triangle.

Newton used binomial theorem to create
&#x222B;<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> (1-x<sup>2</sup>) = &#x222B;(Infinite series)
This was then converged better with
&#x222B;<sub>0</sub><sup>1/2</sup> (1-x<sup>2</sup>) = &#x222B;(rapid convergence Infinite series) with x at 1/2 = &pi;/12 + &#8730;3/8. Rearrange and solve.
