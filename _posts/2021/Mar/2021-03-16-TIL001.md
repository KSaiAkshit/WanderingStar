## Main Stories

### Elephants
Elephants are social (herd) animals with the most genes devoted to smell of any animila. They can smell water from KMs away. They use their trunks as a means of not just drinking and delicate maneuvers but also for communication.

### Lambo Sian
The Lambo Sian has a whole carbon fiber body with assists from ultracapacitors. They charge on breaking.

### Banned Mods in Indian Law
As of 2019 all mods on stock cars are banned as per Indian law. Even paint jobs. Americans cannot import any cars unless its at least 25 yrs old whereas in India as long as emission standards are met and it is RHD (right hand drive), bring it in.

### Bit Banging
A hacky method. Bit Banging is using software to manipulate data instead of hardware. It is only possible because of modern hardware speeds and it exploits the high impedance state in a microcontroller. It provides lower latency and more protocol control but is unreliable in sampling and requires heavy redundancy.
