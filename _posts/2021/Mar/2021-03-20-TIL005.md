## Main Stories

### Nauts in Space
Not everyone is space has a title. Russian trained are Cosmonauts (If sent by govt and trained appropriately) whereas NASA/JAXA/ESA etc trained are Astronauts. Not not every one of these is astronauts there are Pilot Astronauts, Mission Specialist Astronauts, and Payload Specialists. Official language of space is either English or Russian. People usually end up speaking both.

### SwimSuits
Swimmers have low body fat. Body fat floats and muscle sinks. Speedo created polyurethane suits. Shark skin suits. So they used the energy to go forward more than forward and upward. Polyeurathane floats and also creates a boundary layer and reduces friction. These were soon outlawed from Olympics.

### Atomic Clock
Scientists are considering measuring change in weights of mountains using atomic clock. Time slows down due to gravity. So a lighter mountain will have less gravity and time will tick faster.


## QuickBits
> In 2008 olympics Beijing used Rockets & chemicals to prevent any rains during the opening ceremony.


### Mining
Titanium is one of the most abundant materials in the earths crust. But it is not concentrated enough to be mined profitably
