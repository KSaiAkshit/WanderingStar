## Main Stories

### Not Equinox
Days and nights in equinoxes are not equal for 2 reasons.
- Sunrise and sunset have a 7-8 min visible offset due to refraction of the atmosphere. So the sun rises a few mins after it looks so
- We dont define sunrise and sunset at the same points. We define them at opposite points. So there is extra travel time by 1 diameter of the sun.

This accounts to about a total of 15-20 min disparity in a 12-12.

### Daylight saving is uselss
We used to save daylight in times where there was no electricity. We now have electricity. So what's the point bro. At the equator it is always 12-12. In NYC it is around 16-8. The poles have it 24-0. So a one hour shift is meaningless in any case.

## Analysis

### Aliens
We are not afraid of aliens coming and enslaving us based on any data but the fact that we do that to ourselves. Everytime any civilisation has had visitors. It has not gone well for them

> We have science because our sensory system is extremely poor.
