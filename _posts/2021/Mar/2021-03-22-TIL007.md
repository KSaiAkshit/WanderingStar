*Cover Djibouti & Bab El Mandeb*

## Prime Stories

### Djibouti
Japan's first and only military base since WW2 is in Djibouti. This probably because Japanese constitution prevents them from having a military other than for self defence.

Somalia Just to it's south is currently under Civil war with Al-Shabab against the Federal governement. About half of the country also wants independence to be recognised as somaliland.

Djibouti is located right on the Bab-al Mendeb Straight which is the world's most pirated area, part of reason to why there are so many military bases in Djibouti (Mostly NATO countries). This is the only way to access EU from Indian ocean without going all the way around.

Recently china also made their first foreign naval base in Djibouti. This is messing with the americans lol.


## Main Stories

### Not Equinox
Days and nights in equinoxes are not equal for 2 reasons.
- Sunrise and sunset have a 7-8 min visible offset due to refraction of the atmosphere. So the sun rises a few mins after it looks so
- We dont define sunrise and sunset at the same points. We define them at opposite points. So there is extra travel time by 1 diameter of the sun.

This accounts to about a total of 15-20 min disparity in a 12-12.

### Daylight saving is uselss
We used to save daylight in times where there was no electricity. We now have electricity. So what's the point bro. At the equator it is always 12-12. In NYC it is around 16-8. The poles have it 24-0. So a one hour shift is meaningless in any case.

### Shakespeare can't be french
French does not have lexical stresses all stress is on the last syllable by default. This also makes it impossible to have limericks in french.

## Quotes


## Analysis

### Aliens
We are not afraid of aliens coming and enslaving us based on any data but the fact that we do that to ourselves. Everytime any civilisation has had visitors. It has not gone well for them

> We have science because our sensory system is extremely poor.

> If the earth rotates faster, coriolis force increases. So storms rotate faster. Jupiter is larger and rotates 2x Earth. **Just Imagine**

> Since we also move ahead as we rotate. Sun takes >24hrs to return to its position & stars take <24 hrs to return to their position. (About 1&deg; or abour 4 mins)
