## Main Stories

### Jupiter
Taylor–Proudman theorem (after Geoffrey Ingram Taylor and Joseph Proudman) states that when a solid body[clarification needed] is moved slowly within a fluid that is steadily rotated with a high angular velocity Ω, the fluid velocity will be uniform along any line parallel to the axis of rotation. Ω must be large compared to the movement of the solid body in order to make the Coriolis force large compared to the acceleration terms.

### Storing Anti Matter
Anti matter is stored in an electro-magnetic field bathtub to prevent it from touching the walls and annhialating. This is a type of Penning–Malmberg Trap. As of 2017 we had made only a total of 10ng ever.

### Parkinsons
Scientists are using Glial cells and converting them into neurons to cure parkinsons. We also know that glial cells are reliably reproduced throughout adulthood. These glial cells also can produce dopamine and therefore cure parkinsons. Live mice show promising results. Scientists are also converting carcinoma cells into neurons. Cancer into intelligence bruh.

## QuickBits
> Sun rises in the east and sets in the west ONLY ON THE EQUATOR.

> Dark matter does not just not interact with matter or light, but also does not with itself

> We can't see stars in the day not because sun is too bright but because atmosphere is glowing. Otherwise we wouldn't see them from the moon also

## Analysis

### Treatments
We used to treat first by eating humans (ancient times). Then we treated by animals and then their parts (Mice, Bubonic Plague | Cows, Small Pox). Now we use bacteria & viruses. Based on the trendline these probably will go away too in favour of chemicals & other molecular treatments.
