# PRIME STORIES

## *Bell X-15*
The bell X-1 had 4 seperate engines which would ignite selectively at differnt temperatues. The X-15 could not do this, it was to be the fastest aircraft ever created (6.7Mach).

Bell X-15 which had to deal with temperatures much higher than even the SR-71 was made out of Inconel. SR-71 had peak surface temperatures of 400&deg;C. X-15 had to do 1000. So it was made of Ni + Cr + Fe + Nb = Inconel X. This was FAAAR more resistant to extreme temperatures but about 2x heavier.

Robert White pilot of X-15 was the first person ever to fly an airplane to space. William Knight also with X-15 still holds 6.7Mach record for highest speed every on an aircraft.

# MAIN STORIES

### Breaching BBB
Scientists have found ways to make nanobots that can breach the Blood-Brain Barrier. They use EColi to construct the bot and Rotating Magentic fields to move it around such that it then accumulates in brain. [*ScienceRobotics*](https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/6/52/eaaz9519)

### Timing F1
Transponders on F1 cars allow them to be tracked to within a ten thousandth of a second by transmitting radio waves. Timing loops are set about 1 cm into the F1 track, built out of lengths of wire that run across the width of the track and back protected in silicone. They’re spaced out every 150-200 m along the track, every time a car passes over it registers with the car’s transponder, transmitting a unique ID to a decoder that logs the time of day.

### Lab Testing
Mice are the ideal candidates for lab testing because it is possible to order up mice identical to each other or some other mouse elsewhere because of its sequences. We can control exact mutations also

### Laser Audio
Lasers can be pointed to a window at a distance. The reflection of this laser can then be used to see what the pattern is. Audio & any other sound causes micro vibrations in glass which can be then converted to waveform.

### Roche Limit
Is a formula which calculates how close an object (say moon) can come to its parent (say planet) before the tidal forces of the planet rip it apart and create something like a saturn.
$$L_p = 2.44 (\frac{\rho_p}{\rho_s})^{1/3} R_p$$

### Chatalhöyük
We know from exacavations of Chatalhöyük from Anatolia (Turkey) from about 7000 BC show that society was egalitarian and no concept of a heirarchy existed. This were also the first people to probably use maps.

### Holi
Most of India's color is made in Hathras, UP. This brings in a business of about $4M to the city. A 100 people work in both hand made and machine made systems. The production capacity is heavily dependent on agriculture season (inversely) and rain (inversely) since the color needs to be dried in open air.

### Shannon
Was the first to convert sounds to 1s & 0s and send that as pulses which can then be converted back to voice thus eleminating the noise of long distance analog audio and also creating the concept of bits.

### Senbonzakura

Japan's cherryblossom peaks have been more or less consistent since 800s to 1800s for 1000 years. Since the industrial revolution due to all the carbon we have been dumping the planet is heating up more and more as a result of whichs summer is coming earlier & they bloom earler.

### from the tyres to below the tyres
Scientists have optimized a process to convert waste from rubber tires into graphene that can, in turn, be used to strengthen concrete. Concrete is the most-produced material in the world, and simply making it produces as much as 9% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. This process reduces the concrete usage and also makes it longer lasting

0.1 wt% of graphene can reinforce the road by as much as 30% more.

### VLBI
Scientists are using Very Long Base Interferometry to calculate the motion of the techtonic plates and the rotation of earth. Quasars very far away act like point sources of light and can be used to track subtle changes in the distance between two observatories and therefore the plates below.

### Kuramoto
Synchronisations of clocks first observed by Christian Huygens in 2 pendulum clocks (also invented by him for ships) hung from the same pole. The model used to calculate the motion of these pendulums on mapped onto a circle is called Kuramoto model. It uses the own frequency and also distance from other vectors on the circle to calculate the the motion

### Shimbashira
Horyuji Temple, Japan is the world's oldest structure built from tree wood. It uses a central wooden structure called a Shimbashira to stabilize against earthquakes, thus also inspiring the tokyo sky tree (the world's tallest broadcasting tower).

The central structure is connetced to several oil dampers and uses them to stabilize the building.

### FairyFlies
There are about 1400 species of wasps called the fairyFlies. These are all smaller than paramoencium. We believe that this is probably the lower limit to how small insects can be.
They have less than 8000 neuron.

### Portable Powerstation
Russia is building portable power stations which they will use in the newly usable north where ice is melting. They will deploy these nuclear powered ships to generate electricity for about 200K people in nothern port cities to develop them further. It is named Akademik Lomonosov

### Horizontal Gene Transfer
WHiteflies have shown a gene which neutralises Phynolic Glycosides a series of toxins which the plants produce to keep insects away. This gene is believed to have been stolen from planets itself long ago. This could probably be the earliest known case of horizontal gene transfer.


# QUICKBITS

> The creators of silicon valley would randomly go to google to look for new stories and solutions to problems

> In a chain of clicking the first link on every wiki page. The end point will be philosophy (95% of the time) which then loops back.

> Institutional legacy is for those who live in the luminosity of the ones before them who have achieved something. It is for those with nothing of their own ~ NDT

> Voyager2 was actually sent 16 days before V1. V1 just took a shorter path and hence passed V2.

> Atomic Clocks, Radar and Automatic Computer Engine were all invented at NPL London.

> The amazon rainforest is now net carbon positive.

> Everytime a patent is filed it must be used within 3 years in a product for that name to be used.

> Evergiven was probably stuck in Suez because of the bank effect.
