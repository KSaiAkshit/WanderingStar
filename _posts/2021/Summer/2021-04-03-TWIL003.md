# PRIME STORIES


# MAIN STORIES

### Breaching BBB
Scientists have found ways to make nanobots that can breach the Blood-Brain Barrier. They use EColi to construct the bot and Rotating Magentic fields to move it around such that it then accumulates in brain. [*ScienceRobotics*](https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/6/52/eaaz9519)

### Timing F1
Transponders on F1 cars allow them to be tracked to within a ten thousandth of a second by transmitting radio waves. Timing loops are set about 1 cm into the F1 track, built out of lengths of wire that run across the width of the track and back protected in silicone. They’re spaced out every 150-200 m along the track, every time a car passes over it registers with the car’s transponder, transmitting a unique ID to a decoder that logs the time of day.

### Lab Testing
Mice are the ideal candidates for lab testing because it is possible to order up mice identical to each other or some other mouse elsewhere because of its sequences. We can control exact mutations also

### Laser Audio
Lasers can be pointed to a window at a distance. The reflection of this laser can then be used to see what the pattern is. Audio & any other sound causes micro vibrations in glass which can be then converted to waveform.

### Roche Limit
Is a formula which calculates how close an object (say moon) can come to its parent (say planet) before the tidal forces of the planet rip it apart and create something like a saturn.
$$L_p = 2.44 (\frac{\rho_p}{\rho_s})^{1/3} R_p$$

### Chatalhöyük
We know from exacavations of Chatalhöyük from Anatolia (Turkey) from about 7000 BC show that society was egalitarian and no concept of a heirarchy existed. This were also the first people to probably use maps.

### Holi
Most of India's color is made in Hathras, UP. This brings in a business of about $4M to the city. A 100 people work in both hand made and machine made systems. The production capacity is heavily dependent on agriculture season (inversely) and rain (inversely) since the color needs to be dried in open air.

### Shannon
Was the first to convert sounds to 1s & 0s and send that as pulses which can then be converted back to voice thus eleminating the noise of long distance analog audio and also creating the concept of bits.

### Senbonzakura
![BlossomPeaks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BBX3XWO3RBA47DHDZMIBTRRTYE.PNG&w=916)
Japan's cherryblossom peaks have been more or less consistent since 800s to 1800s for 1000 years. Since the industrial revolution due to all the carbon we have been dumping the planet is heating up more and more as a result of whichs summer is coming earlier & they bloom earler.

### from the tyres to below the tyres
Scientists have optimized a process to convert waste from rubber tires into graphene that can, in turn, be used to strengthen concrete. Concrete is the most-produced material in the world, and simply making it produces as much as 9% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. This process reduces the concrete usage and also makes it longer lasting

0.1 wt% of graphene can reinforce the road by as much as 30% more.

### Crypto
Facebook has renamed Libra to Diem and intends to make it a stable crypto currency. Unlike traditional crypto, stable crypto is tied to physical money like say the US Dollar. Visa has also launched their own crypto.

### VLBI
Scientists are using Very Long Base Interferometry to calculate the motion of the techtonic plates and the rotation of earth. Quasars very far away act like point sources of light and can be used to track subtle changes in the distance between two observatories and therefore the plates below.

### Kuramoto
Synchronisations of clocks first observed by Christian Huygens in 2 pendulum clocks (also invented by him for ships) hung from the same pole. The model used to calculate the motion of these pendulums on mapped onto a circle is called Kuramoto model. It uses the own frequency and also distance from other vectors on the circle to calculate the the motion

# QUICKBITS

> The creators of silicon valley would randomly go to google to look for new stories and solutions to problems

> In a chain of clicking the first link on every wiki page. The end point will be philosophy (95% of the time) which then loops back.

> Institutional legacy is for those who live in the luminosity of the ones before them who have achieved something. It is for those with nothing of their own ~ NDT

> Voyager2 was actually sent 16 days before V1. V1 just took a shorter path and hence passed V2.
