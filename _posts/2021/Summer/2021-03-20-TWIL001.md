# PRIME STORIES

## *Evolution*
Because of the square-cube law it is that we don’t see animals that are very large today. Say for instance a hundred meter high bird. Which is also the largest trees we know max out around 120 meters. So if asked to choose between fighting a horse sized duck and 100 duck sized horses. It is better to choose the duck. Because the duck’s feet would snap like toothpicks. So earlier on earth when O2 in the atmosphere was around 30% (vs 21% now) due to higher surface area and being able to absorb O2 directly from skins we had much larger insects, say a dragonfly of the size of an eagle. This same law is also why in water since fishes experience no gravity. Whales are much much larger but since they are mammals and stay near the surface also have an upper limit. On planets which have low gravity, deep oceans, and non mammal fishes, it may be possible to see much larger fishes.

Evolution doesn't always reach the optimum point. Since we can only move in a direction which is up gradient (imagine a whole surface (x,y,z) of traits where z value is their advantage) so as a consequence we can not grow wings for example, since it needs to be such that every step towards having a wing needs to have a distinct advantage or at least a non-disadvantage to it.

## *Territorial Waters*
A region of 12 nautical miles outside coast of any country is territorial sea. For 200 nautical miles outside land the nation has exclusive economic zone or sole rights to resourse exploitation. In case of conflict each country resolves on case by case basis. Such as India-Sri Lanka where USUALLY midway line is drawn. Most un countries have signed this except Syria, Israel & Turkey. Their waters are therefore still under dispute mainly in the Aegean Sea.

As a consequence of these disputes also Cyprus is now divided into Republic of Cyprus (Internationally recognised) and Turkish Republic of Cyprus (Only Turkey recognised). Search for gas is making this worse. This currently creates two different sea ownership maps. One agreed upon by Greece-Egypt and one by Turkey-Libya.

Of all of the worlds gas reserves the highest are held by Russia followed by Iran then Qatar & USA. Iraq economy is dependent on 98% exports of Oil & Azerbaijan is also along similar lines 91% mineral products. Turkey on the other hand imports 30% of its national electricity source which is Natural Gas from Russia (50%) and rest Iran, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Nigeria and Qatar.

The Turkstream pipeline and the Trans-Balkan Pipeline can be used to make turkey also a transit country and the lines were recently updated to make direction of flow reversible.


# MAIN STORIES

### Tsunamis in Planets
- It is theoreised that Mars had an ocean but does not show a shoreline because a mega-tsunami wiped out this shoreline.
- Venus has clouds which move much much faster than the planet. This is probably because of surface waves which push air up.
- Titan around saturn has a tilted orbit compared to rings and hence genrates a slight lift wave in the rings which precesses around with the moon.

### Big Buildings
While very tall most buildings don't have a lot of usable ground area. Ex burj khalifa does not fall even in the top 10 skyscrapers by ground area (main building only measured). The largest being China's new finance center (as of Current date).

### Elephants
Elephants are social (herd) animals with the most genes devoted to smell of any animila. They can smell water from KMs away. They use their trunks as a means of not just drinking and delicate maneuvers but also for communication.

### Lambo Sian
The Lambo Sian has a whole carbon fiber body with assists from ultracapacitors. They charge on breaking.

### Banned Mods in Indian Law
As of 2019 all mods on stock cars are banned as per Indian law. Even paint jobs. Americans cannot import any cars unless its at least 25 yrs old whereas in India as long as emission standards are met and it is RHD (right hand drive), bring it in.

### Bit Banging
A hacky method. Bit Banging is using software to manipulate data instead of hardware. It is only possible because of modern hardware speeds and it exploits the high impedance state in a microcontroller. It provides lower latency and more protocol control but is unreliable in sampling and requires heavy redundancy.

### Whale Hunting
It has been noticed that over years whales have developed defences against whale hunting as time for each hunt increases and whale strike rate fell by 58%. [*Royal Society*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0030?af=R&)

### Monoamines
Depression is cause by a lack of monoamines in the brain. Most importantly Seratonin. This was first cured reliably by Fluxotine (or Prozac in '88) it was a first of kind Selective Seratonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI).

### Neom in Saudi
Saudi Arabia is building Neom. A linear city where living is in 3 levels. The ground level is the citizens and greenery. The -1 level is commercials and -2 level is services (like transportation). The city aimes to be fully sustainably run.

A linear city has been tried beofre also in Brazil. The city brazillia was supposed to be linear but it did not work out to be so due to high prices along the line. As a result of which new satellite cities started forming up in the end breaking the linear model.

## Market Makers
Payment for order flow is illegal in UK and everything goes to exchange. Market makers in both cases payment for order flows (0 commission) and otherwise collect the bid ask spread. SEC USA allows their existance as long as they declare who they route to. But Gamestop volatility is creating a problem here & is therefore under review.

### Nauts in Space
Not everyone is space has a title. Russian trained are Cosmonauts (If sent by govt and trained appropriately) whereas NASA/JAXA/ESA etc trained are Astronauts. Not not every one of these is astronauts there are Pilot Astronauts, Mission Specialist Astronauts, and Payload Specialists. Official language of space is either English or Russian. People usually end up speaking both.

### SwimSuits
Swimmers have low body fat. Body fat floats and muscle sinks. Speedo created polyurethane suits. Shark skin suits. So they used the energy to go forward more than forward and upward. Polyeurathane floats and also creates a boundary layer and reduces friction. These were soon outlawed from Olympics.

### Atomic Clock
Scientists are considering measuring change in weights of mountains using atomic clock. Time slows down due to gravity. So a lighter mountain will have less gravity and time will tick faster.

> In 2008 olympics Beijing used Rockets & chemicals to prevent any rains during the opening ceremony.

### Marketting
Medical marketting is not always negetive. It can have positive effects. The marketting of Prozac resulted in a decrease in stigmatisation of depression and higher acceptance in society.


# ANALYSIS

### Calculating Pi
Till before Newton we used sandwitch of inscribed and circumscribed larger and larger polynomials. Newton used binomial theorem with negetive and fractional numbers and extended the Pascals triangle.

Newton used binomial theorem to create
$$\int_0^1 1- x^2 \,dx$$ = &#x222B; (Infinite series)
This was then converged better with
$$\int_0^{1/2} 1- x^2 \,dx$$ = &#x222B; (rapid convergence Infinite series) with x at $$1/2 = \pi/12 + \sqrt{3}/8$$. Rearrange and solve.

### Winning Guess Who
Use binary search. Eliminate 50% people each time. that way 24&rarr;1 in &le;5 moves.

### Nightingale Diagrams
Plotting around with shadded areas instead of x and y so that data can loop back on itself and be continuous. (Asset Exam aptitude was a primitive form of nightingale diagrams where radius or distance was the metric and not area).

### Mining
Titanium is one of the most abundant materials in the earths crust. But it is not concentrated enough to be mined profitably
