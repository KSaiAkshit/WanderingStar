*Cover Bell X-15 Inconel X*

## Main Stories

### FairyFlies
There are about 1400 species of wasps called the fairyFlies. These are all smaller than paramoencium. We believe that this is probably the lower limit to how small insects can be.
They have less than 8000 neuron.

### Inconel
Bell X-15 which had to deal with temperatures much higher than even the SR-71 was made out of Inconel. SR-71 had peak surface temperatures of 400&deg;C. X-15 had to do 1000. So it was made of Ni + Cr + Fe + Nb = Inconel X. This was FAAAR more resistant to extreme temperatures but about 2x heavier.

Robert White pilot of X-15 was the first person ever to fly an airplane to space. William Knight also with X-15 still holds 6.7Mach record for highest speed every on an aircraft.
