# PRIME STORIES

## *First Life*
ABout 2.3BYA Cyanobacteria was probably the first life form that emerged and in water along with the Anerobes who polluted the earth with loads of oxygen (this also created Ozone). Then after multiple ice ages we had the Cambrian Explosion which created rapid diversification of life.

NASA catagorises celestia objects based in 5 catagorises of threat of life. Moon is a Catagory 1, kuch bhi kar lo kuch nai hoga. Saturn & Jupiter are Cat2, most life will get destroyed on entry to atmosphere. In this Solar System only Enceladus, Saturn; Europa, Jupiter; Earth and Mars are Cat5. Earth is a restricted Cat5.

# MAIN STORIES

### Religion & Pay
New research indicates that religion perpetuates the gender wage gap. The findings provide evidence that men tend to earn significantly more than women in societies with heightened religiosity. [*Academy of Management Journal*](https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2019.1254)

### ADHD also has ADHD
Hyperfocus, a common — but confusing — symptom of ADHD, is the ability to zero in intensely on an interesting project or activity for hours at a time. It is the opposite of distractibility, and it is common among both children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

### Jericho
The Jericho watch tower has the world's oldest staicase. Something older than 5000 years already even before the first pyramid was built. It took 11000 years to build.

### Atom MRI
Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) scientists bring the tip of the microscope close to the atoms on the surface of the material. The e<sup>-</sup> cloud from the material jumps on to the atom. This is still very less information

Scientists applied an Fe atom to the tip and started a magentic field followed by a radio frequency this created an atomic mri.

### Penguings
Penguins have the densest feathers of any bird, a few thousands per square inch. They also can spend months swimming and usually come to shore just to build a nest.

### Debt
Most of American media makes propoganda news that china has loaned them a lot of money. But that is only 5% (~$1T) of the total, America's largest creditor is actually Japan.

### Broca's Areas
Functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown language processing to also involve the third part of the inferior frontal gyrus the pars orbitalis, as well as the ventral part of BA6 and these are now often included in a larger area called Broca's region

### Vavilov
Nikolai Vavilov was the first person to figure out centers of origins of plant species and that interbreeding some species can make them resistant to cold thus solving Soviet Union's frequent food shortage due to famine problem. Stalin killed Vavilov by Starvation. Vavilov and his team created and defended the World Seed Vault to Death.

### Insulin in a pill
By using nanomaterial layers to package insulin, researchers have developed a stable and effective method for administering the hormone orally to rats without subjecting it to destruction by stomach acids, solving a long-time problem in pharmaceutical science. [*RoyalSocietyofChemistry*](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/SC/D0SC05328G#!divAbstract)

### Nukes
Since in nukes the neutrons can bounce back and escape from a heavy atom, a tamper is used to keep contain the neutron to the region. In Japan (Little Boy) Tungsten Carbide was used. In Fat Man uranium shell itself was used as a tamper as a spherical shell shock wave was used to start the bo

### Errors
Planes accumulate errors over time since the current position is calculated based on the last known position. This error adds over over time. ~60m for every 20mins. This is eliminated by using multiple sensors and running the data through a Kalman Filter.

Planes also have a CAT IIIC autoland system which is almost never used unless there is very poor visibility.

### GAAFET
We are reaching the limits of the standard FinFET design. To go below ~5-7nm scientists are considering a Gate-all-Around FET. This is a better way to control flow as the gate surrounds the source-drain bridge thus increasing the surface of contact. We don't need to include multiple gates also since the gates can be of arbitrary length.

### Why Electrons are not particles
Electron, unlike a planet or a satellite, is electrically charged, and it has been known since the mid-19th century that an electric charge that undergoes acceleration will emit EM radiation, losing energy in the process. A revolving e<sup>-</sup> would transform the atom into a miniature radio station, the energy output of which would be at the cost of the potential energy of the e<sup>-</sup>; according to classical mechanics, the electron would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would collapse.

### Drug dev
Human insulin earlier used to be made with pigs. But then scientists took one Protein and put it in EColi and now EColi makes inulin for humans.

We also use animal lab cells to produce Protein. First a ring of the desired ouptput Protein and a nutrient gene is created. The petri dish is flooded with this nutrient and then the rings. Some cells will take in the rings and start consuming the nutrient. Then the nutrient in the dish is dried out. All those who did not accept the ring die and we are left with a protien producing animal double membraned cell (Most commonly CHO Cells)

### Canal top Solar
Modiji had proposed a solar panel array above an irrigation canal system. It had the following benefits:
- No extra land area was used to generate renewable energy
- The covered canal water evaporates less thus providing better and more water to farmers
- This method also keeps the solar panels cooler
- Shading the water also prevents algal blooms making the water toxic

Kochi airport runs on 100% solar power, assisted by the canals running accross it.

### Hummming Birds
Hummingbirds can slow their heart frpm 1200BPM to 50BPM while sleeping. They also use a special figure 8 motion of wings to generate lift both up and down  stroke. Their wing muscles are about 1/3rd of their body weight. Some of these birds consume upto 6 times their body weight of food in one go.


# QUICKBITS

> $$10! = 6!7!$$ is the only known solution to $$n! = a!b!$$

> Mars does not have techtonic plates.

# ANALYSIS

> Probability that a number p is prime is $$1/log n$$

> On an average a prime number has $$log log n$$ factors.
