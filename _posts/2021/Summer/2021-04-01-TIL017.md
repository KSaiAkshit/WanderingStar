## Main Stories

### Shimbashira
Horyuji Temple, Japan is the world's oldest structure built from tree wood. It uses a central wooden structure called a Shimbashira to stabilize against earthquakes, thus also inspiring the tokyo sky tree (the world's tallest broadcasting tower).

The central structure is connetced to several oil dampers and uses them to stabilize the building.
