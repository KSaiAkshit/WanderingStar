## Main Stories

### Enceladus
NASA catagorises celestia objects based in 5 catagorises of threat of life. Moon is a Catagory 1, kuch bhi kar lo kuch nai hoga.

### Jericho
The Jericho watch tower has the world's oldest staicase. Something older than 5000 years already even before the first pyramid was built. It took 11000 years to build.

### Atom MRI
Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) scientists bring the tip of the microscope close to the atoms on the surface of the material. The e<sup>-</sup> cloud from the material jumps on to the atom. This is still very less information

Scientists applied an Fe atom to the tip and started a magentic field followed by a radio frequency this created an atomic mri.

### Penguings
Penguins have the densest feathers of any bird, a few thousands per square inch. They also can spend months swimming and usually come to shore just to build a nest.
