## Main Stories

### Alcohols
Red wines contain polyphenols, when consumed these also increase the blood flow through the arteries and therefore reduce the blood pressure. White wines contain lower polyphenols than red wines. In general the darker the wine, the more polyphenols it contains.
Alcohol makes you eat more. Alcohol concentration is dependent on the amount of water in your body.

### Direwolves
Direwolves are real, they are just not wolves. We have more than 5000 fossils of direwolves dating back to the ICE ages.
