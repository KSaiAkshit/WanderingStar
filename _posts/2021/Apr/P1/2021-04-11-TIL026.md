*Cover Jupiter Aurora*

## Main Stories

### Dark Energy
Dark energy may not exist. It may just be an unknown force exterted by the existing dark matter which behaves like magnetic repulsion. [*AstrophysicalJournal*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abe5a2)

### Magentic Reconnection
When two magnetic flines divergeing come together and  stream of charge particles flows to the source. This if in planets can cause Aurora (ex Jupiter maybe). [*NASA*](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/science-of-magnetic-reconnection)

### Self recognition
The only known species which can recognize themselves in a mirror are elephants, humans, great apes, magpies and dolphins.
