### Nukes
Since in nukes the neutrons can bounce back and escape from a heavy atom, a tamper is used to keep contain the neutron to the region. In Japan (Little Boy) Tungsten Carbide was used. In Fat Man uranium shell itself was used as a tamper as a spherical shell shock wave was used to start the bo

### GAAFET
We are reaching the limits of the standard FinFET design. To go below ~5-7nm scientists are considering a Gate-all-Around FET. This is a better way to control flow as the gate surrounds the source-drain bridge thus increasing the surface of contact. We don't need to include multiple gates also since the gates can be of arbitrary length.
