*Cover Nuke*

## Main Stories

### Nukes
Since in nukes the neutrons can bounce back and escape from a heavy atom, a tamper is used to keep contain the neutron to the region. In Japan (Little Boy) Tungsten Carbide was used. In Fat Man uranium shell itself was used as a tamper as a spherical shell shock wave was used to start the bo

### Errors
Planes accumulate errors over time since the current position is calculated based on the last known position. This error adds over over time. ~60m for every 20mins. This is eliminated by using multiple sensors and running the data through a Kalman Filter.

Planes also have a CAT IIIC autoland system which is almost never used unless there is very poor visibility.

### GAAFET
We are reaching the limits of the standard FinFET design. To go below ~5-7nm scientists are considering a Gate-all-Around FET. This is a better way to control flow as the gate surrounds the source-drain bridge thus increasing the surface of contact. We don't need to include multiple gates also since the gates can be of arbitrary length.

### Why Electrons are not particles
Electron, unlike a planet or a satellite, is electrically charged, and it has been known since the mid-19th century that an electric charge that undergoes acceleration will emit EM radiation, losing energy in the process. A revolving e<sup>-</sup> would transform the atom into a miniature radio station, the energy output of which would be at the cost of the potential energy of the e<sup>-</sup>; according to classical mechanics, the electron would simply spiral into the nucleus and the atom would collapse.
