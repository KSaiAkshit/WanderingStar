Khloe K had a picture of here leaked which was unphotoshoped. She put out some post saying she can't live up to impossible beauty standards. The beauty standards that she and her family created in the first place.

Girls can't even post a picture of their face without filters on them. How do you explain the though process of looking at you own face and deciding this is not good enough for the world to see.
