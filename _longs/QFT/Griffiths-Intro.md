### Introduction

In quantum mechanics the outcome is not uniquely determined by the initial conditions; all we can hope to calculate, in general, is the probability for a given transition to occur. This indeterminacy is reflected in the observed behaviour of particles. For example, the charged pi meson ordinarily disintegrates into a muon plus a neutrino, but occasionally one will decay into an electron plus a neutrino. There’s no difference in the original pi mesons; they’re all identical. It is simply a fact of nature that a given particle can go either way.
